# Building My Own Network (Cisco Packet Tracer Lab)

This project demonstrates a custom virtual network I designed and implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer for hands-on practice with networking essentials.

## 🖥️ Overview

- Created a simulated enterprise network topology using Cisco Packet Tracer.
- Practiced configuring switches, routers, and end devices.
- Applied knowledge of VLANs, IP addressing, and routing.
- Explored troubleshooting common network connectivity issues.
